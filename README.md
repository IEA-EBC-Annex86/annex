# `Annex`; Annex86 Data Analysis Package

<!--<img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="200" style="float:right; height:200px;">-->

## Installation

The R package `annex` provides a series of functions and methods to easily
process measurement data for the IEA EBC Annex86 project, as well as writing
(and validating) the final file intended to be used to build a data repository
for research in the field related to the project.

**Install via remotes**

The package is currently hosted on github and can be installed via
the [`remotes`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package by
calling `remotes::install_github()` from within an active R session. Note
that you may need to install the remotes package first.

```
library('remotes')
install_github("Annex86/annex")
```

**Dependencies**

The `annex` package available via this repository has a few dependencies
required to process the data. R should automatically resolve backwards
dependencies on installation. For more information, have a look at the
[DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/IEA-EBC-Annex86/annex/blob/main/DESCRIPTION)
file on github.com.
