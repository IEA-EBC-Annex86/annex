# `Annex`; Annex86 Data Analysis Package

## Installation

TODO(R): Installation instructions; depends a little bit on where
the package will be hosted. Something along the lines of:


**If published via CRAN**

```
install.packages("Annex")      # If provided via CRAN
```

**If hosted on [github](https://github.com)**

```
library("remotes")
install_github("user/Annex")   # If hosted on github
```

**Access via token on [UIBK gitlab](https://git.uibk.ac.at)**

Must be set up first, but is possible for non-registered users.

```
library("remotes")
repos  <- "https://gitlab+deploy-token-80:AB_CDEFGHabcdefghx_o@git.uibk.ac.at/c123456/Annex.git"
install_git(repos)
```
