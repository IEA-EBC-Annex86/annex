<p>As the data sets from the different campagnes will come in various formats, the <code>annex</code> package cannot provide import functions, however, a series of demos are provided to read some common formats.</p>
<p>In this case, the data set comes as a text/CSV file which can easily be read using <em>Rs</em> <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/read.table.html" class="external-link">read.table()</a></code> function (see <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/read.table.html" class="external-link">?read.table</a></code>). The demo data set comes in the format expected by the convenience funtion <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/read.table.html" class="external-link">read.csv()</a></code>, thus all needed is …</p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>The S3 method <code>is.regular()</code> can be used to check whether or not the observations of an <code>annex</code> object is strictly regular (or at least regular). Regularity means that the intervals between observations are always a multiple of the shortest interval recorded (e.g., hourly data).</p>
<p>Strictly regular checks if the intervals are all the same, i.e. hourly without any gaps.</p>
<p>The return of the function is a logical vector where the name corresponds to ‘study - home - room’.</p>
